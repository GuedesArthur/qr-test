# QR Code Test
This repository contains a test code for encoding strings to QR Codes using Raylib and QR Code generator library (C), by Project Nayuki (https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library).

I'll be using snippets of this codebase in future projects, so don't expect many updates on this little repo...
